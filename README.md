# BetterConjoint

There are two components to this software.
1) A piece that takes a design and some assumptions and produces some statistics about how wrong your AMCEs will be on average (MSE, correlation, % too extreme)
2) A piece that takes conjoint results and an assumption about measurement error and runs SIMEX
